            <h2>My 5 favorite resources for learning JavaScript</h2><br>
            <p>A couple of times I was asked on my Instagram about resources for learning, and since I already wrote a little about CSS and some cool tools, I decided to dedicate this post to the JavaScript resources I was (or still am) using.</p>
            <p>Since I first started learning a couple of years ago, some of these might be considered outdated, or using some tools or methods that have since been updated; I still included them, since it's not only about the code, but teaching some very important principles that can be applied to most programming languages and tools.</p>
            <p>So here's <em>my 5 favorite resources for learning JavaScript:</em>
                (the fact there's 5 is purely coincidental :) )</p> <br>

            <h3>1. JavaScript & JQuery</h3>
            <address>by Jon Duckett</address>
            <a href="http://javascriptbook.com/" target="_blank">javascriptbook.com</a> <br>
            <img src="image/js (2).png" alt=""><br>

            <p>Even though it might be considered "old", it is still one of the best laid-out, organized and illustrated books I've ever studied from.</p>

            <p>It is beautifully designed, with graphs, illustrations and visual aids that help immensely with understanding the point.            </p>

            <p>Perfect for visual learners, as well as a reference book for when you need to revisit the fundamentals!            </p>

            <p>One thing worth noting is, if you are getting this book, make sure to get the latest edition, since the early ones had some errors in them. </p> <br>

            <h3>2. Practical JavaScript</h3>
            <address>by Gordon Zhu </address>
            <a href="https://watchandcode.com/" target="_blank">watchandcode.com</a> <br>
            <img src="image/js (4).jpg" alt=""><br>

            <p>A great free online course that does a great job of explaining some of the most important concepts, such as functions, objects and conditional logic.            </p>

            <p>It stresses the importance of planning your app's features in advance (instead of jumping straight into coding), and grouping your code into objects - for the sake of better readability and organization, as well as slowly leading us into the world of OOP.            </p> <br>

            <h3>3. YouTube Tutorials</h3>
            <address>by Traversy Media </address>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia" target="_blank">youtube.com/techguyweb</a> <br>
            <img src="image/js (2).jpg" alt=""><br>

            <p>My most favorite YouTube tutorials are made by Brad Traversy, AKA Traversy Media, but of course, there are many others.
            </p>

            <p>Brad has a huge repository of high-quality videos, with everything a Front-end developer might need, as well as a couple of other topics.

            </p><br>

            <h3>4. #JavaScript30</h3>
            <address>by Wes Bos </address>
            <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">javascript30.com</a> <br>
            <img src="image/js (1).jpg" alt=""><br>

            <p>A very fun and a bit more advanced collection of 30 exercises and cool mini-projects, each focusing on a different JS feature.
            </p>

            <p>Wes Bos has become somewhat of a guru in the front-end development world. His teaching style is interesting, but also a bit faster than what I was used to, and also somewhat more advanced, so I would definitely recommend learning the basics of JavaScript before jumping into this one.
            </p> <br>

            <h3>5. You Don't Know JavaScript</h3>
            <address>by Kyle Simpson            </address>
            <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" target="_blank">github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS</a> <br>
            <img src="image/js (3).jpg" alt=""><br>

            <p>A 6-book series, each diving into a core concept of JavaScript and descritibng it in-depth, helping you to better understand how JS works "under the hood".
            </p>

            <p>Just like with the previous one, I recommend previous basic JS knowledge. </p>
            <p>As allways, feel free to send me questions or suggestions for more posts.            </p>
            <p>Any question regarding JS or other tools, I'll try to answer the best I can.            <p> <br>
             <p>Have a great week! </p><br>
